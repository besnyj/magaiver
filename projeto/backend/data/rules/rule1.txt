LCI: What it is: An LCI is a fixed-income security issued by financial institutions (banks) to raise funds specifically for financing the real estate sector. When you invest in an LCI, you're essentially lending money to the bank, which then uses those funds to grant loans for residential and commercial properties, construction projects, and other real estate-related activities.

     Purpose: To boost the real estate market by providing a source of funding with favorable conditions.

     Key Characteristics:

     Issuer: Banks and other financial institutions.

     Underlying Asset: Real estate loans and financing.

     Guaranteed by FGC: LCIs are typically guaranteed by the Fundo Garantidor de Créditos (FGC - Credit Guarantee Fund) up to R$ 250,000 per CPF per institution, providing a layer of security for investors.

     Maturity: Can vary, but they often have minimum lock-up periods. Recent regulatory changes have adjusted these minimum terms.

     Taxation (Important Update): Historically, LCIs were exempt from Income Tax (IR) for individual investors. However, as of a Medida Provisória (MP) announced in June 2025, new LCIs issued from January 1, 2026, onwards will be subject to a 5% Income Tax on their earnings. Existing LCIs purchased before this date will retain their tax exemption until maturity.

LCA: What it is: Similar to an LCI, an LCA is a fixed-income security issued by financial institutions to raise funds, but in this case, the capital is directed exclusively to financing the agribusiness sector. This can include funding for harvests, acquisition of agricultural equipment, expansion of agro-industrial activities, and other related ventures.

     Purpose: To stimulate the agribusiness sector in Brazil, a crucial part of the country's economy, by providing access to credit.

     Key Characteristics:

     Issuer: Banks and other financial institutions.

     Underlying Asset: Loans and financing for agribusiness activities.

     Guaranteed by FGC: Like LCIs, LCAs are also generally guaranteed by the FGC up to R$ 250,000 per CPF per institution.

     Maturity: Also subject to minimum lock-up periods, which have seen recent adjustments.

     Taxation (Important Update): Historically, LCAs were exempt from Income Tax (IR) for individual investors. Similar to LCIs, new LCAs issued from January 1, 2026, onwards will be subject to a 5% Income Tax on their earnings, while existing LCAs purchased before this date will remain tax-exempt until maturity.

CRI: What it is: A CRI is a fixed-income security that represents a future credit right from the real estate sector. Unlike LCIs, CRIs are typically issued by securitizadoras (securitization companies), not banks. These securitization companies purchase various real estate receivables (such as mortgage payments, rental fees, or installments from property sales) from companies in the real estate sector and then package them into CRIs, which are sold to investors.

     Purpose: To provide a mechanism for real estate companies to raise capital by selling their future cash flows, allowing them to finance new projects or manage their liquidity.

     Key Characteristics:

     Issuer: Securitization companies.

     Underlying Asset: A pool of real estate receivables.

     No FGC Guarantee: A crucial difference from LCIs and LCAs is that CRIs are not guaranteed by the FGC. The investor's risk is tied to the credit quality of the underlying receivables and the securitization company.

     Longer Maturities: CRIs often have longer maturities compared to LCIs and LCAs.

     Liquidity: Generally less liquid than other fixed-income investments, meaning it might be harder to sell them before maturity without a discount.

     Taxation (Important Update): Historically, CRIs were exempt from Income Tax (IR) for individual investors. Similar to LCIs and LCAs, new CRIs issued from January 1, 2026, onwards will be subject to a 5% Income Tax on their earnings, with existing CRIs purchased before this date retaining their exemption.

CRA: What it is: Analogous to the CRI, a CRA is a fixed-income security representing future credit rights from the agribusiness sector. Like CRIs, CRAs are issued by securitizadoras that acquire agribusiness receivables (such as future payments from agricultural sales, rural leases, or financing for agricultural inputs) from companies in the agribusiness sector and then package them into CRAs for investors.

     Purpose: To enable agribusiness companies to obtain funding by securitizing their future receivables, supporting the growth and operational needs of the sector.

     Key Characteristics:

     Issuer: Securitization companies.

     Underlying Asset: A pool of agribusiness receivables.

     No FGC Guarantee: Like CRIs, CRAs are not guaranteed by the FGC. The investor bears the credit risk of the underlying receivables and the securitization company.

     Longer Maturities: CRAs also tend to have longer maturities.

     Liquidity: Typically less liquid than FGC-guaranteed instruments.

     Taxation (Important Update): Historically, CRAs were exempt from Income Tax (IR) for individual investors. Similar to the other incentivized assets, new CRAs issued from January 1, 2026, onwards will be subject to a 5% Income Tax on their earnings, with existing CRAs purchased before this date retaining their exemption.

Pós-fixado: Post-fixed investments are those whose returns are linked to an economic index that fluctuates over time. The exact return is only known at the time of redemption or maturity.

            How they work: The investor knows the index and the percentage of that index they will receive, but the actual monetary value of the return will depend on the performance of the index.

            Common Indexes in Brazil:

            CDI (Certificado de Depósito Interbancário - Interbank Deposit Certificate): This is the most common reference for post-fixed investments in Brazil. The CDI rate closely follows the Selic rate (Brazil's benchmark interest rate). Many post-fixed assets offer a percentage of the CDI (e.g., 100% of CDI, 110% of CDI).

            Selic Rate: The basic interest rate of the Brazilian economy, set by the Central Bank. Some investments, like certain Treasury Bonds (Tesouro Selic), are directly indexed to it.

            IPCA (Índice de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo - Broad Consumer Price Index): Brazil's official inflation index. Investments linked to the IPCA offer a real return (a fixed interest rate) plus the variation of the IPCA (e.g., IPCA + 5%). This protects the investor's purchasing power against inflation.

            When they are suitable: Post-fixed investments are generally favored in scenarios of rising interest rates or high and uncertain inflation, as they allow the investor to benefit from the upward movement of the underlying index. They also provide more flexibility for shorter-term goals due to their daily liquidity in some cases (e.g., Tesouro Selic).

            Examples: Most CDBs (Certificados de Depósito Bancário), Tesouro Selic, and many LCIs/LCAs are typically post-fixed (e.g., "CDI + X%").

Pré-fixado: Pre-fixed investments are those where the exact return is defined at the time of the investment. The investor knows precisely how much they will receive at maturity, regardless of how interest rates or inflation behave during the investment period.

            How they work: The interest rate is fixed upfront (e.g., 10% per year). This rate remains constant throughout the investment term.

            When they are suitable: Pre-fixed investments are attractive when the investor anticipates a fall in interest rates or expects inflation to be lower than the pre-fixed rate offered. By locking in a higher rate, the investor benefits if market rates decline. They provide predictability for financial planning.

            Risks: The main risk is that interest rates or inflation rise significantly above the pre-fixed rate, leading to a real loss of purchasing power or an opportunity cost compared to post-fixed alternatives.

            Examples: Some CDBs, LCI/LCA, and certain Treasury Bonds (Tesouro Prefixado) are available with pre-fixed rates.

            Important Note on Taxation (as of June 2025):

            The recent Medida Provisória (MP 1.303/2025) significantly alters the tax landscape for these assets. While LCI, LCA, CRI, and CRA traditionally enjoyed Income Tax exemption for individual investors, new issuances of these securities from January 1, 2026, onwards will be subject to a 5% Income Tax on their rendimentos. Assets already acquired by December 31, 2025, will maintain their tax exemption. This change aims to rebalance public accounts and reduce distortions in the market, though these assets will still be considered "incentivados" due to their lower tax rate compared to the standard 17.5% for most other traditional fixed-income investments.

In Brazil, SELIC, CDI, and IPCA+ are fundamental economic indicators and benchmarks that significantly influence the fixed income investment landscape. Understanding them is crucial for anyone investing in the country.

SELIC (Sistema Especial de Liquidação e de Custódia - Special System for Settlement and Custody)
What it is: The SELIC rate is Brazil's benchmark interest rate, akin to the federal funds rate in the United States or the base rate in the UK. It is the primary tool used by the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB - Central Bank of Brazil) to implement its monetary policy, primarily to control inflation.


How it works: The SELIC rate is the weighted average interest rate of overnight interbank operations collateralized by federal government securities, carried out within the Special System for Settlement and Custody (also called SELIC). The Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the Central Bank meets every 45 days (or extraordinary meetings if necessary) to set the target for the SELIC rate.


Impact on the Economy:

Inflation Control: By raising the SELIC rate, the Central Bank makes credit more expensive, discourages consumption, and encourages savings, which tends to reduce inflation. Conversely, lowering the SELIC rate stimulates economic activity.

Investment Returns: It directly influences the profitability of many fixed-income investments, especially those linked to the SELIC itself (like Tesouro Selic bonds) or the CDI.

Borrowing Costs: It serves as a benchmark for interest rates charged on loans to individuals and companies, impacting mortgages, personal loans, and business financing.

Significance for Investors: Investors often look at the SELIC rate to gauge the attractiveness of fixed-income investments. When the SELIC is high, fixed income generally becomes more appealing.

CDI (Certificado de Depósito Interbancário - Interbank Deposit Certificate)
What it is: The CDI is an interest rate that serves as a benchmark for interbank transactions in Brazil. It represents the average rate of overnight (one-day) loans between financial institutions (banks) to ensure they meet their daily reserve requirements at the Central Bank.

How it works: Banks often need to lend or borrow money from each other on a very short-term basis to balance their cash flow. These interbank loans are typically registered and settled by a clearinghouse (historically CETIP, now part of B3). The average rate of these daily operations forms the CDI.

Relationship with SELIC: The CDI rate closely tracks the SELIC rate. Banks use the CDI as a reference for their internal operations, and because the SELIC is the basic interest rate in the economy, banks tend to lend to each other at a rate very close to it. Usually, the CDI is slightly below the SELIC.

Significance for Investors:

Benchmark for Post-Fixed Investments: The CDI is the most common benchmark for post-fixed fixed-income investments in Brazil. Many investments, such as CDBs, LCIs, and LCAs, offer returns expressed as a percentage of the CDI (e.g., "100% of the CDI," "120% of the CDI").

Liquidity Reference: It indicates the cost of short-term money in the financial system.

IPCA+ (Índice de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo + Fixed Rate)
What it is: IPCA+ is a form of remuneration for fixed-income investments, particularly common with Brazilian government bonds (Tesouro Direto, specifically Tesouro IPCA+). It means the investment pays a return that is composed of two parts:

IPCA (Índice de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo - Broad Consumer Price Index): This is Brazil's official inflation index, calculated and published by the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). It measures the average change in prices paid by families with incomes ranging from 1 to 40 minimum wages.

A fixed real interest rate: This is a pre-determined percentage that is added on top of the IPCA.

How it works: An investment indexed to IPCA+ (e.g., "IPCA + 5%") will pay the investor the exact percentage of inflation measured by the IPCA during the investment period, plus an additional 5% in real terms. This means your purchasing power is protected, and you receive an extra gain on top of it.

Significance for Investors:

Inflation Protection: The primary benefit of IPCA+-indexed investments is that they protect the investor's purchasing power against inflation. Regardless of how high inflation goes, your investment will at least keep pace with it.

Real Return: The "plus" component (the fixed rate) represents your real gain, after accounting for inflation.

Long-Term Strategy: These investments are particularly suitable for long-term goals (e.g., retirement planning, purchasing a property in the distant future) where preserving purchasing power over time is crucial.

Example: If you invest in a bond paying "IPCA + 5%" and the IPCA for the year is 8%, your total return for that year would be approximately 13% (8% + 5%). If the IPCA is 4%, your return would be 9%.

In summary, SELIC is the central bank's policy rate, CDI is the interbank lending rate that closely follows SELIC and serves as a benchmark for many investments, and IPCA+ is an indexing method for investments designed to protect against inflation while providing a real return.
